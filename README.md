## 🚧 Commit Structure Notice

Due to computational and GPU hardware limitations, all training, inference testing, and integration steps were performed on a single local machine. This constraint required centralized development, and thus all Git operations (including commits and pushes) originated from the same device.

Advantages of this approach:
- Ensured consistent CUDA and PyTorch environment for model training
- Avoided serialization/deserialization issues with large-scale checkpoints
- Direct and quick access to logs, weights, and intermediate outputs

## 🧠 Model Training Details

- Object Detection Backbone: **Ultralytics YOLOv8**
- OCR Engine: **Microsoft TrOCR (Transformer OCR)**
- Auxiliary OCR: **Google Cloud Vision API**
- Image Preprocessing & Feature Extraction: **Torch + TorchVision**

### 🎯 Model Accuracy

- **mAP@0.5**: `0.995` (Mean Average Precision at IoU threshold 0.5)
- **F1 Confidence Curve Score**: `1.00`
- **Confusion Matrix**: Flawless performance on actual Sanskrit manuscript datasets.  
  ➕ Refer to the `results/` folder for sample predictions and benchmarking screenshots.
